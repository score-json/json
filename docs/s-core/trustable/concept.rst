Concept
=================

*The* `Trustable Software Framework (TSF) <https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/index.html>`_
*approach is designed for consideration of software where factors such as safety, security,
performance, availability and reliability are considered critical. Broadly it asserts that any
consideration of trust must be based on evidence.*

The tenets and assertions defined in the Trustable Software Framework can be used to measure an (OSS) project trust score.
To calculate the score link evidences to the Trustable Assertions (TA).
