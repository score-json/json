# Custom references

References establish links between the documentation and artifacts of the project, either internal (e.g. lines of code) or external (e.g. files stored on a server). 

For each item of the trustable graph, the hash is calculated by trudag using:
   
* its own name
* the text of its own statement
* its normativity status
* for every of its references, the *content* of that reference
* for every of its fallacies, the description and content of the corresponding reference

Custom references are defined in `references.py`. A (custom) reference is used by adding an object into the list `references` in the header of the item file. The `type` corresponds to the classmethod `type` of a reference class of `references.py`, and the remaining object correspond to the arguments of the constructor.

## CPPTestReference

The content of a `CPPTestReference` is given by the lines of code corresponding to a test-case or a section of a test-case in the unit-tests given in tests/src and TSF/tests.

For the `CPPTestReference` an example is:
```
---
...

references:
- type: cpp_test
  name: "compliance tests from json.org;expected failures"
  path: "tests/src/unit-testsuites.cpp"
---
```

## JSONTestsuiteReference

The content of a `JSONTestsuiteReference` is given by the lines of code corresponding to a test-case or a section of a test-case in the unit tests, where a (list of) specified test-file(s) located on an external test-repository is utilized, and the content of these test-files.

For the `JSONTestsuiteReference` an example is:
```
---
...

references:
- type: JSON_testsuite
  name: "compliance tests from json.org;expected failures"
  path: "tests/src/unit-testsuites.cpp"
  test_suite_paths: 
    - "/json_tests/fail2.json"
    - "/json_tests/fail3.json"
  description: "invalid json"
  remove_other_test_data_lines: False # optional, the default value is True 
---
```

## FunctionReference

The content of a `FunctionReference` is given by the code inclusive all comments of a C++ function within a class in a specified file in the repository. The specific position, i.e. start- and end-line, of the code within that file is not part of the content.  

For the `FunctionReference` an example is:
```
---
...

references:
- type: function_reference
  name: "basic_json::accept"
  path: "include/nlohmann/json.hpp"
---
```

Since functions may be overloaded, a `FunctionReference` can be initialised with an optional overload-parameter; additionally, it is possible to give a description. The full example is:
```
---
...

references:
- type: function_reference
  name: "basic_json::accept"
  path: "include/nlohmann/json.hpp"
  description: "the public interface of the `accept`-functionality of nlohmann/json"
  overload: 2
---
```

## WebReference

The content of a `WebReference` is its url. This reference is intended to be utilised in case that the content of the web-site is constantly changing (e.g. due to a clock being implemented somewhere on the site), but the reviewer is certain that the type of the content and it being supportive of the statement is fulfilled as long a the website is reachable. An example is `https://introspector.oss-fuzz.com/project-profile?project=json`, where the most recent fuzz-testing report for nlohmann/json is published.

For the `WebReference`, an example is:
```
---
...

references:
- type: website
  url: "https://math.stackexchange.com/"
---
```
An example of `WebReference` with non-empty description is
```
---
...

references:
- type: website
  url: "https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+Serre-Swan+theorem"
  description: "Wiki article on the smooth Serre-Swan theorem"
---
```

## WebContentReference

The content of a `WebContentReference` is its content. This reference is intended to be utilised in case of *static* references, that should not vary in a short time-frame, and whose content is most important for the trustability of the statement. An example is a file located on a github repository, e.g.  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/.github/workflows/cifuzz.yml`

A `WebContentReference` looks identical to a `WebReference` with `type: web_content` instead of `type: website`.

For the `TimeVaryingWebReference`, examples of the possible configurations are:
```
---
...

references:
- type: web_content
  url: "https://math.stackexchange.com/"
---
```
in case of an empty description, and
```
---
...

references:
- type: web_content
  url: "https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+Serre-Swan+theorem"
  description: "Wiki article on the smooth Serre-Swan theorem"
---
```
in case of a custom description.

## TimeVaryingWebReference

The content of a `TimeVaryingWebReference` is given by the content of a changelog, whose default value is `ChangeLog.md`, which mirrors the changelog of nlohmann/json. This reference is intended for websites, whose content is constantly changing, so that a `WebContentReference` makes the item un-reviewable, but whose content at the time of an update influences the trustability. An example is `https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pulse/monthly`, which can be used to demonstrate that nlohmann/json is *up to the most recent version* under active development.

An example of the complete configuration for `TimeVaryingWebReference` is

in case of a custom description.

## TimeVaryingWebReference

The content of a `TimeVaryingWebReference` is given by the content of a changelog, whose default value is `ChangeLog.md`, which mirrors the changelog of nlohmann/json. This reference is intended for websites, whose content is constantly changing, so that a `WebContentReference` makes the item un-reviewable, but whose content at the time of an update influences the trustability. An example is `https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pulse/monthly`, which can be used to demonstrate that nlohmann/json is *up to the most recent version* under active development.

An example of the complete configuration for `TimeVaryingWebReference` is

```
---
...
references:
- type: project_website
  url: "https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+Serre-Swan+theorem"
  description: "Wiki article on the smooth Serre-Swan theorem"
  changelog: "ideas/graded/graded_Serre_Swan.tex"
---
```
where `description` and `changelog` are optional arguments.

## ListOfTestCases

The content of a `ListOfTestCases` is given by the list of test-cases extracted from the unit-tests given in the files in the provided directories. 
It is assumed that a unit-test is saved in a file with the name unit-xxx.cpp, and only those files are used to compile the list. 
Further, it is assumed that a unit-test-file is structured as

```
...
TEST_CASE("my test case")
{
    ...
    SECTION("my section")
    {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

and the structure regarding test-cases and (nested) sections of test-cases is extracted. The expected configuration is 

```
---
...
references:
- type: list_of_test_cases
  test_files:
    - TSF/tests
    - tests/src
---
```

# Validators

Validators are extensions of trudag, used to validate any data that can be reduced to a floating point metric. The resulting scores are used as evidence for the trustability of items in the trustable graph.

## check_artifact_exists

The check_artifact_exists script validates the presence of artifacts from GitHub Actions workflows for the current SHA. The score is given based on the number of artifacts found vs the number of artifacts expected.

The available configuration dict keys for check_artifact_names are:
  - `check_amalgamation`
  - `codeql`
  - `dependency_review`
  - `labeler`
  - `test_trudag_extensions`
  - `ubuntu`

The available configuration dict values for check_artifact_names are:
  - 'include'
  - 'exclude'

These indicate whether a certain artifact should be included as evidence for a Trustable graph item.

## https_response_time

The automatic validator https_response_time checks the responsiveness of a given website. The expected configuration is as in the example:
```    
evidence:
    type: https_response_time    
    configuration:
        target_seconds: 2 # acceptable response time in seconds, integer or float
        urls: # list of urls to be checked, list of strings
            - "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues"
            - "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/graphs/commit-activity"
            - "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/forks?include=active&page=1&period=&sort_by=last_updated"
```
A response time of at least the five-fold of the acceptable response time is deemed inacceptable and gives an individual score of zero.
Likewise inacceptable is a response code other than `200`, which gives an individual score of zero.

The total score is the mean of the individual scores.

## check_test_results

The automatic validator `check_test_results` is intended to evaluate the database `TestResults.db` which is generated in the Ubuntu-Workflow, and which contains the test-report of the most recent workflow run. This database is temporary, and, contrary to `TSF/TestResultData.db`, which is persistently stored on the branch `save_historical_data`, not persistently stored.

The expected configuration is given as follows:

```
evidence:
    type: check_test_results
    configuration:
        tests: # list of test-files 
            - test-class_lexer
            - test-unicode1
            - test-strings
        database: TestResults.db # optional argument, default: TestResults.db; path to test-result database from project root
        table: test_results # optional argument, default: test_results; name of table in database
```

For each test specified in test-files, the number of passed and failed test-cases is calculated, while the number of skipped test-cases is ignored. The score of each test is then the ratio of passed test-cases compared to all non-skipped test-cases; the total score is the mean of the individual scores.

    configuration:
        tests: # list of test-files 
            - test-class_lexer
            - test-unicode1
            - test-strings
        database: TestResults.db # optional argument, default: TestResults.db; path to test-result database from project root
        table: test_results # optional argument, default: test_results; name of table in database
```

For each test specified in test-files, the number of passed and failed test-cases is calculated, while the number of skipped test-cases is ignored. The score of each test is then the ratio of passed test-cases compared to all non-skipped test-cases; the total score is the mean of the individual scores.

# Data store interface

The data store interface utilises the built-in the `dump` functionality of trudag to store the trustable score, and to include the development of the trustable score over time into the report.

Since no persistent data store is established as of now, the current implementation serves as a proof of concept, where the collected data are stored on a separate branch of the repository.

The input of the data store are the data generated by the trudag tool during the `score` or `publish` operation. These data have the format:

```
[{"scores": [{id: "ID-1", "score": score}, ...], "info": {"Repository root": "my_repository", "Commit SHA": "sha_123", "Commit date/time": "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y", "Commit tag": "my_tag", "CI job id": 123, "Schema version": 123, "Branch name": "my_branch"}}]
```

## push

This functionality writes the generated data into an sqlite database `TrustableScoring.db` located in the folder `TSF`. This database contains two tables, `commit_info`, where the metadata of "info" are stored, and `scores`, where the scores are stored, and which references `commit_info` via the date as foreign key.

It is intended to store data only once per commit. If, for any reason, the same commit generates data more than once, then only the most recent data are stored, and the obsolete data are deleted. This still ensures that the scoring history of the main branch is as complete as possible.

## pull

This functionality parses the information stored in `TrustableScoring.db` into the format which is expected by trudag. In case that no data are found, the empty history is returned.
