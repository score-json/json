#### Checklist for TA-INDICATORS from [Codethink](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/print_page.html)

* How appropriate/thorough are the analyses that led to the indicators?

    Answer:  There are no warning indicators for the none misbehaviours for the use of the library for parsing and verification of JSON data according to RFC8259.

* How confident can we be that the list of indicators is comprehensive? 

    Answer:  Since there are none, the list is not comprehensive at all.

* Could there be whole categories of warning indicators still missing?

    Answer:  Yes, there could. These warning indicators, however, should be implemented in the wrapper defining the interface between the library and the project using it.

* How has the list of advance warning indicators varied over time?

    Answer:  It has stayed constant.

* How confident are we that the indicators are leading/predictive?

    Answer: There are none.

* Are there misbehaviours that have no advance warning indicators?

    Answer:  There are no misbehaviours identified.

* Can we collect data for all indicators? 

    Answer:  We do collect data for all indicators that are currently implemented.

* Are the monitoring mechanisms used included in our Trustable scope? 

    Answer:  No, but there are also none.

* Are there gaps or trends in the data? 

    Answer:  There are no data.

* If there are gaps or trends, are they analysed and addressed?

    Answer:  There are no data.

* Is the data actually predictive/useful?

    Answer:  There are no data.

* Are indicators from code, component, tool, or data inspections taken into consideration?

    Answer:  There are no indicators.
