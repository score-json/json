Known bugs or misbehaviours are analysed and triaged, and critical fixes or mitigations are implemented or applied.

aschemmel-tech: I think it needs more verbose content to describe why the above statement is true. For example copy from the TA template:

Evidence

1. List of known bugs fixed since last release - see JLS-11
2. List of outstanding bugs still not fixed, with triage/prioritisation based on severity/relevance/impact - see JLS-11, but no evidence of triage
3. List of known CVEs fixed since last release - not available
4. List of outstanding CVEs still not fixed, with triage/prioritisation based on severity/relevance/impact - not available
5. List of nlohman/json component versions, showing where a newer version exists upstream - does nlohman/json have components it uses?
6. List of component version updates since last release - does nlohman/json have components it uses?
7. List of fixes applied to developed code since last release - same as 1.
8. List of fixes for developed code that are outstanding, not applied yet - similar to 2. but solution proposed but not merged - not available
9. List of nlohman/json faults outstanding (O) - same as above
10. List of nlohman/json faults fixed since last release (F) - same as 1.
11. List of nlohman/json  faults mitigated since last release (M) - not available

small score is from the not available evidences
