#### Checklist for TA-UPDATES from [Codethink](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/print_page.html)

* Where are the change and configuration management controls specified?

    **Answer**:  WIP

* Are these controls enforced for all of components, tools, data, documentation and configurations?

    **Answer**:  The S-CORE Methodology is followed, compliance with which enforces the change process to be followed.

* Are there any ways in which these controls can be subverted, and have we mitigated them?

    **Answer**:  Yes, the change process can just not be followed. We have no real method to enforce it other than to trust that the committers follow the S-CORE processes.

* Does change control capture all potential regressions? 

    **Answer**:  Due to the test coverage of 99.186%, it is unlikely that a potential regression is not captured.

* Is change control timely enough? 

    **Answer**:  Not applicable, as far as can be understood right now, there is no immanent need to keep the library up to date. 

* Are all guidance and checks understandable and consistently followed? 

    **Answer**:  WIP
