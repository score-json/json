The S-Core methodologies are followed.

aschemmel-tech: As already agreed, we need separate statements on the processes/manual reviews applied for nlohman and for S-CORE.
For nlohman part we could refer to the github reviews of every PR before merge, is there some guideline/checklist to do this?
How many people do this review (e.g. does Mr. Lohman approve all?) How do we judge the quality of the review (comments)?
For S-CORE we need to describe how those are used to verify the nlohman lib, e.g. if we add tests these are reviewed with S-CORE checklists.
