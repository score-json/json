A score is calculated based on the number of mirrored and unmirrored things.

aschemmel-lib: This statement should be about "evidence of repeatable builds". Mirroring is one aspect, but also the "internet access" topic, the repeatability on different server and how much the used tools are under our control (i.e. are these available during our product lifecycle). For example do we need CMake, Doctest mirrored?
