The service decodes UTF-8 data.

aschemmel-tech: It seems that JLEX-01 > WFJ-07 > NJF-12 is something like a requirement derivation. Which seems to be ok for JLEX-01 to WJF-01 to 08 (split up of the req),
But what about WFJ-07 > NJF-12 (only) - these seem to not match entirely ("checks" vs. "decode") and again NJF-12.1 to 6 seem rather to cover WFJ-07.
